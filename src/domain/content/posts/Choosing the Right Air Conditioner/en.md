## Consider Your Space’s Characteristics

When choosing the right air conditioner, it’s important to consider the characteristics of the space where it will be used. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

- Well-insulated spaces may perform efficiently with a lower-capacity unit.  

### Sunlight Exposure and Window Count
- Rooms exposed to sunlight will have higher cooling demands.  
- Spaces with large windows may require increased capacity for energy efficiency.
